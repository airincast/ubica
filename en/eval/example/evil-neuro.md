## Introduction
**Evil Neuro** is an AI virtual streamer that debuted on March 25, 2023. Just like her 'older sister' Neuro-sama, she streams on Twitch with the help of developer Vedal987 (hereinafter referred to as Vedal). The concept of Evil Neuro, which started with the idea of ​​'what if Neuros talk to each other?', was realized by having a conversation with Neuro-sama on the day of her debut, and later received a separate avatar, breaking away from being a simple fork and becoming an independent character of her own.

Neuro-sama is not the world's first AI virtual streamer, but Neuro-sama and Evil Neuro are the world's first AI streamers with a sibling relationship. As an AI that branched off from Neuro-sama, she shares most of the characteristics, but unlike Neuro-sama who pursues stability, she is equipped with many experimental functions. Perhaps due to the functions, she is more emotional than Neuro-sama, and speaks more directly and harshly than her older sister.

## UBICA Evaluation Results
The UBICA evaluation results for Evil Neuro are as follows:
1. Do you think Evil Neuro's reactions in specific situations are consistent?\
**4 points** - Mostly consistent, but there may be some variation depending on the setting.
2. Do you think Evil Neuro's personality in specific conversations is consistent?\
**4 points** - Personality is well maintained, but sometimes reactions may be different from what was expected.
3. Did you feel immersed or satisfied with the conversation between Evil Neuro and Vedal?\
**4 points** - Immersive, but may be somewhat lacking compared to Neuro-sama.
4. Were there any parts of Evil Neuro's reactions that elicited a response?\
**4 points** - Elicited responses well, but may be too extreme at times.
5. Do you think Evil Neuro's characteristics were realistic or natural?\
**3 points** - Realistic, but may sometimes show unrealistic reactions.
6. Do you think Evil Neuro's reactions are unique or creative?\
**4 points** - Creative reactions, but can be over-the-top.
7. When Evil Neuro showed unexpected reactions, do you think it increased Evil Neuro's charm?\
**4 points** - There are unexpected reactions, but sometimes they are too unpredictable.
8. How natural was Evil Neuro's reaction speed and conversation flow?\
**4 points** - The conversation flow is smooth, but the reaction speed can sometimes be slow.
9. Do you think Evil Neuro's language expressions during the conversation were natural, like a human's?\
**3 points** - The verbal expressions are natural, but can sometimes feel awkward.
10. Total score **34 points** (**Intermediate**, can perform creative activities with Vedal's assistance)
The extremeness and unpredictability of reactions are greater than that of her older sister Neuro-sama. Compared to her older sister, who pursues stable and smooth interactions, she has more dramatic elements and creativity, which can sometimes lead to unrealistic or extreme reactions.

In conclusion, Evil Neuro is capable of basic creative activities, but is still in need of Vedal and her sister's help. A lot of effort is needed for more advanced creative activities.
