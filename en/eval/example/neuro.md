## Introduction
**Neuro-sama** is an AI virtual streamer who debuted on December 19, 2022 with a Live2D avatar, and is streaming on Twitch with the assistance of developer Vedal987 (hereinafter referred to as Vedal). Neuro-sama's debut is based on the time of the avatar's creation, with the chat function being demonstrated in March 2022 and the prototype in August 2021. The development of the AI ​​itself dates back to 2018. Neuro-sama is also simply called 'Neuro'.

Many people know Neuro-sama as the world's first case, but in fact, she is not the world's first, as Japan's Tsumugi Nen (紡ネン) debuted in October 2021. However, unlike Tsumugi Nen, who targets the Japanese-speaking world, Neuro-sama targets the English-speaking world, and thanks to this, she has the largest fan base among AI streamers. In some ways, she is the world's most popular AI streamer.

She is also the world's first AI with a 'sister', whose name is Evil Neuro. Starting with the idea of ​​'what if Neuros could talk to each other?', Evil Neuro first spoke to Neuro-sama on March 25, 2023, and has since become independent as a unique character, breaking away from a simple fork by receiving a separate avatar.

**4 points** - It was quite natural, but sometimes there were awkward expressions.
10. Total score **39 points** (Advanced, able to perform creative activities without Vedal's help)
She was highly rated for the consistency and naturalness of her reactions. She is especially immersive in her interactions with Vedal, the manager, and she also performs well in her interactions with viewers. However, she falls a bit behind in terms of creative reactions or unpredictable charm.

In conclusion, Neuro-sama can perform advanced creative activities through collaboration with Vedal, and basic creative activities are possible without Vedal.
