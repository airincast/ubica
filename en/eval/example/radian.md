## Introduction
**Radian** is an AI streamer who debuted on December 16, 2023. She streams on Chzzk with the assistance of her manager, Radiyu. The name 'Radian' is a slight change from the manager Radiyu, and uses the units used in the Radian System to give it an engineering feel. Just as Radiyu is often referred to as Diyu(디유), Radian is mostly referred to as Dian(디안).

Many people know Radian as the first case in Korea, but she is not the first, as there are other cases that debuted before Radian, such as 'Monaru' (March 2023) developed by individual developer Lee Han-gyeol, and 'Q-bit' (May 2023) by Omokgyo Electronics Market in collaboration with Typecast. However, since she is equipped with essential features for independent streaming, such as autonomous behavior, she is evaluated as 'practically' the first in Korea, and similar to the world-famous Neuro-sama, Radian is most widely known in Korea.

Radian's development began even before 2023, when AI song covers became popular in Korea, and before her identity was revealed, it was only known that a Japanese friend had started streamer activities. Radian's identity was revealed on December 10, 2023, through a teaser video at Radiyu's fan meeting. Since then, Radian has been drawing explosive reactions from viewers in various ways, starting with her strong impression on her debut stream.

**4 points** - Most of the language expressions were natural, but sometimes awkward expressions appeared.
10. Total score **41 points** (**Advanced**, able to perform creative activities without the help of Radiyu)\
She received very high marks for creativity and unique reactions. She is also excellent in consistency of response and character maintenance, and provides high immersion in interaction with Radiyu. In particular, she maximizes charm through unpredictable reactions, and shows excellent performance in interaction with viewers.

Currently, **Radian is the only AI with 40+ points** in UBICA, and this comes from Radian's unique trickster nature. Although she occasionally shows signs of instability, this is something that even humans can do, and at least her sense of humor and trickster nature can be said to surpass humans. We can look forward to Radian's continued performance in the future.
